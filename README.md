# Word It Up

This is a plugin used for demonstration purposes in a blog post: http://cameronspear.com/blog/craft-cms-twig-filter-extension/

It's a pretty worthless plugin, but was used (as described in the mentioned post) as a how-to on how to build a [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) Extension plugin for the CMS [Craft](http://buildwithcraft.com/).
